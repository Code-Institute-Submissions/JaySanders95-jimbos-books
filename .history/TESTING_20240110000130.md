### Bugs/Issues and Resolutions

#### Gmail SMTP

When setting up email confirmation throughout the project, I came across an issue when submitting the contact form. The information inputted by the user (name, email address, and message) was not being sent to the terminal. 

Resolution:
My webhook was not sending the data correctly, with some minor fixes to broken code this was fixed.

#### Books not displaying correctly

The books were not displaying correctly in their respective places and this was causing many problems

Resolution:
The static root file was incorrectly placed.

#### Stripe payments

My payment intent was failing

Resolution:
The JS file contained other JS code, when this was removed it worked.

#### JQuery not working

None of my Jquery code worked throughout the site

Resolution:
There were two Jquery files which were clashing, one was removed.

#### Staff settings not rendering correctly

I had a couple of bugs/issues with page, there were rendering issues and incompatibilities

Resolution:

Rather than extend base.html every time, create a staff settings menu and then extend that.

#### User Checkout
There was an issue where the delivery price was £4.00 even if there were no items in the bag.
Resolution:
Added an if statement that would only use the delivery price if there were items in the bag.

## Manual Testing
### Scenario 1
-	Create an account and purchase a book
The steps for this included
-	Creating an account
-	Navigating to the books page
-	Adding items to the bag, I attempted to add more than 99 and this was not permitted
-	Completing the checkout form, I attempted to add non alphanumerical characters to every field except email and this was not permitted
-	Checking my orders history + emails, I tried to refresh the page but was met with an error that there was nothing in the bag.
This was completed and worked as expected

### Scenario 2
-	Leave a review as a User and as a non user
The steps for this included
-	Creating an account
-	Navigating to reviews
-	Leaving a review
This was completed and was shown on the home page
As a non-logged in user:
-	Navigate to reviews
-	I could not leave a review and was redirected to the login page
### Scenario 3 
-	Visit a page not in the directory
Steps:
-	I tried to visit a page with /cheese
-	Was met with a 404 error and this redirected me back to the home page.

Vigorous testing was made at every avenue to “break” the code and this was not deemed possible after bug fixes were implemented. The site validation would not allow it.
